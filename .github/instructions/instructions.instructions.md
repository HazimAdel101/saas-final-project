Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and files. This project is a Next.js application with a focus on a dashboard layout using the Shadcn UI library.

2. **Component Usage**: Familiarize yourself with the components available in the `src/components` directory. These components follow a consistent design language and should be used to maintain UI consistency.

3. **Styling**: The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. When adding or modifying styles, use Tailwind's utility classes. Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.

4. **TypeScript**: The project is written in TypeScript. Ensure that all new code is type-checked and follows the existing type definitions.

5. **ESLint Rules**: Adhere to the project's ESLint rules for code formatting, style, and error prevention. Always fix linting errors and warnings before submitting code.

6. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure that each function, component, and module has a single, well-defined responsibility. Avoid combining unrelated logic.

7. **Testing**: Write tests for any new features or components. Follow the existing testing patterns in the project.

8. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality by following best practices for readability, maintainability, and performance. Use descriptive variable names, and keep functions small and focused.

9. **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed when making changes to components or functionality. This includes comments in the code as well as any relevant markdown files.

10. **Collaboration**: Communicate with other team members when making significant changes. Use pull requests to propose changes and seek feedback.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that the project remains well-organized and maintainable as it grows.
